        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Selena’s Salvadorian Restaurant is named after the family’s beautiful and loving daughter, Selena. The restaurant is a reflection of family, tradition, and the flavors of El Salvador brought to Tucson with care and pride.</p>

        <p>At the heart of the kitchen is Sandra Gonzalez, a devoted mother whose passion for cooking has shaped the menu. Sandra prepares each meal using recipes passed down through generations, with every pupusa, tamale, and traditional Salvadorian dish made from scratch. Her cooking carries the warmth of a Salvadorian home, turning each plate into a celebration of culture and family.</p>

        <p>Adding to the experience are Khloe’s helados, a variety of handcrafted ice creams that have quickly become a favorite. With tropical flavors and fresh ingredients, Khloe’s creations bring a sweet and refreshing taste that perfectly complements the savory dishes on the menu.</p>

        <p>Selena’s is more than a place to eat. It is a place where family traditions are shared, Salvadorian culture is celebrated, and every guest is welcomed like part of the family. From the colorful atmosphere to the music and laughter that fill the space, Selena’s invites you to enjoy food made with love and stories worth remembering.</p>
